The Forge CLI provides multiple subcommands to read data on the chain, and each command corresponds to a different data structure on the chain:

- [Read account status](./inspect-accounts)
- [Read transaction status](./inspect-transactions)
- [Read asset status](./inspect-assets)
- [Read block status](./inspect-blocks)
- [Read contract status](./inspect-contracts)
